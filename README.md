# -Multi-Agent-Conversation-and-Stand-up-Comedy

## Overview

This project demonstrates a multi-agent conversation setup using OpenAI's language model. Two agents, Cathy and Joe, both stand-up comedians, engage in a humorous dialogue where they exchange jokes. The conversation is designed to showcase how agents can interact with each other, retain context, and follow specific conversation rules, such as starting a new joke based on the punchline of the previous joke.
